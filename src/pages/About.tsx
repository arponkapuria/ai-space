          Modern AI knowledge is fragmented. Definitions live in one place, research papers in another, tutorials somewhere else, and the relationships between concepts are often left for you to figure out.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-ink-muted">
          AI-Space is an attempt to organize that knowledge into a single visual reference. Instead of treating concepts as isolated entries, it connects them into a knowledge graph where every concept is linked to the ideas that explain it, build upon it, or apply it. The goal isn't just to define terms—it's to provide context.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-ink-muted">
          Whether you're revisiting the fundamentals of linear algebra, understanding why Transformers changed deep learning, or tracing the evolution from supervised fine-tuning to modern LLM post-training techniques, AI-Space helps you explore concepts through their relationships rather than in isolation.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-ink-muted">
          This project is built for students, researchers, engineers, and anyone curious about artificial intelligence. It is open source, continuously evolving, and aims to provide a reliable reference that stays relevant as the AI ecosystem continues to evolve.
